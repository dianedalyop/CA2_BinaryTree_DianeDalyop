FATHER FINDS THE ISLAND
My father hid in the hold for six days and nights.
Twice he was nearly caught when the ship stopped to take on more cargo. 
But at last he heard a sailor say that the next port would be Cranberry
and that they'd be unloading the wheat there. My father knew that the sailors
would send him home if they caught him, so he looked in his knapsack and took out a 
rubber band and the empty grain bag with the label saying "Cranberry."
At the last moment my father got inside the bag, knapsack and all, 
folded the top of the bag inside, and put the rubber band around the top.
He didn't look just exactly like the other bags but it was the best he could do.
